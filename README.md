Built an IoT network communication project integrating NodeMCU (ESP8266) with a Python TCP server to demonstrate low-level socket programming and real-time sensor data transfer. The NodeMCU reads temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and transmits it via TCP/IP over Wi-Fi to a custom backend server running on my laptop. This project highlights my ability to design, debug, and analyze client–server architectures, manage network reliability, and apply theoretical concepts from Computer Networking (Kurose & Ross) in a practical IoT system.
